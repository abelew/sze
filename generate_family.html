Making graph for <% $family %>
ok doofus, remember what the data fields mean.

<%perl>
my $stmt = qq"SELECT id, accession, ms, bc, tc, mp FROM pollen WHERE family = ?";
my $points = $db->MySelect(statement => $stmt, vars => [$family]);
my $bar = new MyGraph(config => $mydb);
my $canvas = $bar->Make_Canvas(width => 400, height => 400, type => 'bar', x_label => 'family', y_label => 'reading', title => 'Family graph', show_values => 1, values_vertical => 1, x_labels_vertical => 1,);
</%perl>

Holy crappers I generated a working canvas with that data on the second try!<br>
Now to make a pretty graph with it!

<%args>
 $family => undef
</%args>
